[00:00.000 --> 00:25.840]  Hi Lucy, nice to meet you. So I understand that you were referred here by your GP because
[00:25.840 --> 00:30.920]  you've been feeling quite down recently. Yeah I thought I should, I've been feeling quite
[00:30.920 --> 00:36.200]  bad for quite a while so I thought maybe it's time to see someone about it because I don't
[00:36.200 --> 00:42.280]  want to feel like this anymore. Okay, so from your notes I saw that you saw the GP about
[00:42.280 --> 00:47.880]  three months ago. Yeah. So how long have you been feeling down altogether? Quite a few
[00:47.880 --> 00:54.320]  months before that as well actually but it's gotten pretty bad these past few months so
[00:54.360 --> 01:01.760]  that's kind of why I came. Okay so has it got worse since you saw your GP? Yeah. Okay so tell
[01:01.760 --> 01:09.160]  me how are things at the moment? Well I kind of started just feeling a bit low and wound up
[01:09.160 --> 01:15.560]  about things but I don't know just recently I just can't really be bothered to do anything
[01:15.560 --> 01:22.200]  at all. I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things and I want to be, I really want to
[01:22.240 --> 01:28.160]  be better but it's just kind of reaching the end now where I just, I want to do something about
[01:28.160 --> 01:35.560]  it. Okay so you said that you're feeling really down, really sad. Yeah. And you feel like you
[01:35.560 --> 01:44.760]  haven't got any motivation but are you okay? Yeah I'm fine, sorry. Okay and you haven't got any
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.360]  motivation but it sounds like you're putting quite a lot of pressure on yourself to try and
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.680]  feel a bit better. Yeah I just, it's kind of hard as well because there's not really anyone to talk
[01:53.680 --> 02:01.760]  about so I just kind of stay on my own trying to, I don't like to think about it but I just know.
[02:01.760 --> 02:06.640]  Okay so you say you've been, you're feeling quite isolated, there's not many people around. Yeah
[02:06.640 --> 02:12.880]  there's no one I can talk to about it, no one would listen or understand anyway. Okay so I'm
[02:12.880 --> 02:17.320]  just going to try and find out a little bit more about you. So I understand that you're an English
[02:17.320 --> 02:25.400]  student at uni and you live away from home with some friends is that right? Yeah I live here. Okay
[02:25.400 --> 02:30.240]  so you don't live far from the uni but you say you feel like, you live with your friends but you
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.920]  don't feel like you can talk to them. Yeah I mean they're lovely, I get on really well with them
[02:35.920 --> 02:43.200]  but I don't know, recently whenever they want to go out or stuff I just, I don't want to bring them
[02:43.280 --> 02:48.000]  down, I can't, they don't understand what I'm going through, they kind of, I don't know, they don't make
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.080]  fun of how I feel but they don't really understand what it's like. I just, I don't want to go out with
[02:54.080 --> 02:59.160]  them and bring them down or stuff. Okay so it sounds, do you try and hide the way you're feeling
[02:59.160 --> 03:05.560]  from them? I guess, I mean it's easier to hide it than to try and explain it all the time when
[03:05.560 --> 03:11.240]  no one really wants to know. Okay so it sounds like you've been feeling down, you've been feeling
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.480]  unmotivated, you feel like you want to be better but actually it sounds like you feel like you
[03:17.480 --> 03:22.600]  can't reach out for help, you can't speak to anybody. No I don't really talk to my parents
[03:22.600 --> 03:28.760]  about either so that's kind of hard. Okay I'm just gonna go back in time a little bit, I suppose I'm
[03:28.760 --> 03:33.400]  just wondering when did all of this start? You said it's been going on for quite a few months.
[03:33.400 --> 03:46.040]  Yeah, I guess it kind of started when I was revising for my exams. I guess the stress,
[03:46.840 --> 03:52.600]  I put a lot of stress on myself, I think I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess for
[03:52.600 --> 03:59.080]  my parents, so the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going
[03:59.080 --> 04:07.080]  through a bit of a troubled time then. Okay so this would be like last March, last April? Yeah
[04:07.800 --> 04:14.120]  I think so. Around that time, so about six months-ish and it sounds like a lot was happening,
[04:14.120 --> 04:21.320]  so you had a lot of uni pressure on and you said that your parents were having marital problems?
[04:21.320 --> 04:29.960]  Yes. Okay and it sounds like that was a real shock to you? Yeah I guess it was hard as well
[04:29.960 --> 04:37.240]  because I wasn't doing well at uni, I guess I just felt a bit guilty. I know it sounds silly but I
[04:37.240 --> 04:44.440]  felt like maybe if I could do better then they would get better but it just wasn't really happening.
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.200]  Okay so it sounds like you were trying to work hard and be more successful because you thought
[04:50.200 --> 04:56.120]  that that would make them happier and try and fix things? Yeah I wanted to make them feel better
[04:56.120 --> 05:03.720]  but it just kind of backfired a little I guess. How did it backfire? It just ended up with them
[05:03.720 --> 05:12.200]  getting worse and I've just been feeling worse since then. Okay so after the summer, after the
[05:12.200 --> 05:19.160]  exam period and how did that exam period go for you in the end? Not very well. Okay that's an awful
[05:19.160 --> 05:25.800]  lot of pressure to put on yourself. It's just annoying because I know I should have done better
[05:25.800 --> 05:33.960]  and I just didn't and I guess I beat myself up a lot about it. So you say I know I should have
[05:33.960 --> 05:39.960]  done better? Yeah. I mean I suppose hearing it from my perspective I'm thinking it sounds like you had
[05:39.960 --> 05:44.600]  an awful lot going on at the time, it would be understandable absolutely that you wouldn't do as
[05:44.600 --> 05:49.560]  well as normal. I suppose I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself?
[05:51.480 --> 05:58.920]  Probably maybe more than other people. My parents have always kind of taught me not in a loving way
[05:58.920 --> 06:07.320]  I guess but that you should do your best but also get the best and I agree with that. I think that's
[06:07.320 --> 06:14.680]  the right thing to think but when I don't do that, I don't know, it annoys me a lot and I
[06:14.680 --> 06:20.920]  worry that it annoys them. So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best? Is that the
[06:20.920 --> 06:29.640]  word you used? Yeah and that there isn't any kind of exceptions for that? No. Okay so I can see
[06:29.640 --> 06:32.840]  then that that was a really difficult time for you and that was when your mood started to get
[06:33.480 --> 06:39.240]  lower and things are still quite bad now. I mean what's the situation with your parents at the
[06:39.240 --> 06:47.960]  moment? I think it doesn't sound good, I don't really talk to them a lot but I don't think
[06:47.960 --> 06:52.840]  they're going through very good. I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me
[06:52.840 --> 06:59.560]  feel worse but I don't think it's getting any better. Were you home over the summer? For a
[06:59.560 --> 07:08.520]  little bit yeah. And how was that? Not very fun, no. It was quite tense all the time,
[07:09.800 --> 07:18.920]  stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer I guess. Okay so it sounds like quite a
[07:18.920 --> 07:23.960]  lot has been happening, you've been feeling very low, you've had uni pressure on, you've had
[07:24.520 --> 07:29.320]  problems with your parents' marriage and it sounds like you feel like you can't really reach out to
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.080]  anyone that you can't understand but you can't really reach out to your parents right now,
[07:33.080 --> 07:37.560]  you can't really confide in your friends. So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell
[07:37.560 --> 07:44.120]  me a bit more about how you've been feeling, I mean say this past week? Really not good to be
[07:44.120 --> 07:52.120]  honest. I actually, if I don't have to then I don't really leave the house or get out of bed,
[07:52.120 --> 07:57.960]  I just I can't find the motivation for the things I used to join. I used to love doing sports or
[07:57.960 --> 08:04.680]  going out and now I just prefer to lie in bed and not really do anything. I missed a few lectures
[08:04.680 --> 08:11.960]  this week that I should have gone to. Right so I suppose I'm just wondering then, let's see if we
[08:11.960 --> 08:17.640]  can think about one thing, say a lecture, what kind of thoughts do you have about going to that
[08:17.640 --> 08:25.640]  lecture before it happens? I don't really see the point anymore, if I can't do as well as I should
[08:25.640 --> 08:33.720]  be doing then what's the point in putting myself in those positions? I just, I can't be bothered
[08:33.720 --> 08:39.880]  anymore to try, it just stresses me out more than I need to. Okay so it sounds like the kind of
[08:39.880 --> 08:45.880]  thoughts you've got in your head are, it's pointless, it's not worth it. Yeah. Do you have
[08:45.880 --> 08:49.880]  any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture?
[08:50.680 --> 09:00.200]  I feel like, I don't know, I don't really even deserve to be here if I can't do well enough.
[09:00.200 --> 09:04.600]  I see all these other students who are doing well and doing better and want to be there.
[09:07.240 --> 09:13.640]  I don't know why I'm here even at uni to be honest. So it sounds like you feel like you're
[09:13.720 --> 09:20.840]  not as good as other people here. Yeah. Okay, I'm just, sorry is it okay if I take notes as we go
[09:20.840 --> 09:25.240]  through? It's just I'm trying to I guess understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.480]  write it down and I'll share this with you later. Okay so it sounds like those are some
[09:31.480 --> 09:35.480]  quite negative thoughts to have, you're kind of saying you know it feels like it's pointless,
[09:35.480 --> 09:41.240]  it's more effort than it's worth and I don't deserve to be here. I mean when you have those
[09:41.240 --> 09:52.280]  thoughts how do you feel? Very unworthy probably would be the best way to put it kind of I don't
[09:52.280 --> 10:01.000]  know lower than normal because then it makes me think about all the things I should have been
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.760]  doing better. Okay so what you described there then you said I'm unworthy, I should be doing
[10:06.760 --> 10:12.200]  lots of things better, those are kind of what I would call thoughts actually. I suppose I'm
[10:12.200 --> 10:17.720]  trying to understand what it feels like in your gut, what kind of emotions do you feel happier,
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.200]  do you feel sad, what kind of emotions are you feeling when you have those thoughts?
[10:24.120 --> 10:32.920]  Sad, not happiness, no sad, a bit of kind of anger and frustration as well. Okay.
[10:37.240 --> 10:40.520]  I notice when you're kind of telling me this and I know this is quite a heavy topic
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.200]  but you're kind of laughing and I suppose I wonder a little bit are you a bit you know how
[10:46.200 --> 10:52.680]  do you feel about having these emotions, talking about these emotions? Embarrassed,
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.080]  I've never yet to talk about it so it's quite uncomfortable to be in this situation. Okay well
[11:01.080 --> 11:05.880]  you're doing a great job because I know that this can be difficult. Okay so it sounds like some of
[11:05.880 --> 11:12.200]  the thoughts you're describing are it's pointless, it's more than it's worth, I don't deserve to be
[11:12.200 --> 11:17.240]  here, I'm unworthy and those kind of thoughts it sounds like they just flip through your mind
[11:18.920 --> 11:22.520]  and then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to, you're kind of
[11:22.520 --> 11:27.160]  describing sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed. What about in your body, what happens,
[11:27.960 --> 11:35.640]  how do you feel kind of physically? I used to be I think from those emotions very wound up,
[11:35.640 --> 11:43.400]  very kind of stressed all the time but recently it's just been a lot more draining than anything,
[11:43.400 --> 11:51.480]  just quite lethargic and I just can't be bothered anymore and it's my body reflects that but then
[11:51.720 --> 11:58.600]  when I try and sleep I just can't seem to have a satisfied night's sleep, it's really,
[11:58.600 --> 12:03.720]  really frustrating. So it sounds like this is affecting you, it's draining you of your energy
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.240]  like your body can't be bothered, I think that's a really good way of describing it
[12:07.240 --> 12:13.480]  and you're noticing sleep problems as well and then what do you do? So we're back to the point
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.520]  before the lecture, so you start having these thoughts, these emotions and you know your body
[12:18.520 --> 12:22.040]  I guess it sounds like those thoughts are quite draining, so they'll be draining your energy.
[12:22.040 --> 12:31.720]  What then happens, what do you do next? I kind of focus on the negative thoughts when I probably
[12:31.720 --> 12:36.760]  should not think about them but I focus on them and then I don't really want to do anything,
[12:37.560 --> 12:43.000]  kind of stay in bed. So you think even more about those kind of worries that you have,
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.840]  so you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.640]  and it sounds like you don't, you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it?
[12:51.640 --> 12:57.400]  No. Or speaking to family. Okay and then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the
[12:57.400 --> 13:01.960]  lecture, you've stayed in bed, you've kind of spent time as you said focusing on those thoughts,
[13:01.960 --> 13:06.360]  those negative thoughts, how do you feel after that? Do you feel better or do you feel worse?
[13:07.160 --> 13:17.000]  I guess I feel a slightly worse but then a bit numb in a way, kind of once you've felt that,
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.360]  because I do feel tired all the time, I just try and push it out and then you don't really think
[13:22.360 --> 13:28.920]  about anything and it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting
[13:28.920 --> 13:35.000]  wrong and how much you can't do stuff. Sometimes it's better just to not think about it,
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.080]  not think about it at all. So it sounds like in some ways it's a bit of a relief to do that?
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.840]  Yeah. But in other ways maybe you think it might make things worse? Probably in the long run, yeah.
